# Lua Table Iteration Bug
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when recursively iterating over tables in Lua using the `pairs` iterator. The `pairs` iterator does not guarantee any specific order of iteration.  This can lead to problems when modifying the table during the iteration, as shown in the `bug.lua` file. The `bugSolution.lua` file provides a corrected implementation.  The solution uses an explicit stack-based approach to maintain order and handle modifications during iteration. This approach ensures that all modifications are properly reflected in the main table.
